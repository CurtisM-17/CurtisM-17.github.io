			<p style="margin : 10">
				I am a 20-year-old student in my second year of the Bachelor of Game Design program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. I started learning how to program games when I was 12 on the Roblox platform, which I credit for giving me the skills and drive to dedicate my career to this industry ever since.
			</p>

			<p>
				At Sheridan, I have been very fortunate to have learned so much from some wonderful professors and classmates who I deeply respect. I am thoroughly looking forward to learning more about making games throughout my career, and my hunger for improvement keeps me constantly welcoming feedback. I am only satisfied when I'm proud of my work, and I am dedicated to self-care to ensure I'm always at my best.
			</p>

			<p>
				While my primary skill is general game programming, I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly, pay close attention to detail, and adapt to new environments. I am very passionate about the industry, not just as an appreciator of existing games, but also in excitement for the future. I firmly believe that games exist to be a new-age form of artistic expression and a way to connect with people in powerful ways, and we are still only at the beginning.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of game development, I am deeply passionate about music and soccer. I strongly believe in empathy and inclusion, not just for the people around me but also for those who experience the games I create. I taught myself how to use HTML and CSS for this portfolio to demonstrate my dedication.
